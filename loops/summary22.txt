# Summary of JavaScript Exercises README

This repository contains JavaScript exercises designed to complement The Odin Project's curriculum. Below is a summary of the key points:

## Setup Instructions
1. **Fork and Clone**: Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. **Install Prerequisites**:
   - **NPM**: Ensure NPM is installed. Verify with `npm --version`.
   - **Jest**: Navigate to the repository directory and run `npm install` to set up Jest.

## Exercise Structure
- Each exercise includes:
  - A markdown file describing the task.
  - A JavaScript file (empty or partially filled).
  - A set of tests.
  - A `solutions` directory with completed solutions and unskipped tests.

## How to Complete Exercises
1. Navigate to the exercise directory.
2. Run tests using `npm test exerciseName.spec.js`.
3. Write code to pass the tests. Initially, tests will fail by design.
4. Change `test.skip` to `test` as you progress through the tests.
5. Ensure all tests pass simultaneously with no `test.skip` remaining.
6. Compare your solution with the one in the `solutions` directory after completing the exercise.

## Debugging
- Use the Visual Studio Code debugger terminal to debug functions.
- Set breakpoints and run `npm test exerciseName.spec.js` in the debugger terminal.

## Notes
- Ignore warnings about outdated or vulnerable packages.
- Do not submit solutions to this repository.
- Suppress Jest error messages with `--silent` if needed.
